#If your a **backend engineer** todays task titled **0x02. i18n** might throw you off, when you get to problem **2. Get locale from request**, to resolve this issue do not install the latest version of babel, as the decorator **localselector** was depreciated, instead install the older version of babel using : **pip install flask-babel==1.0.0**..Enjoy and lets keep on **DO HARD THINGS**


#it is I, when you get to prblem 3. Parametrize templates when run the following command  pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot ., this will raise the following error AttributeError: module 'jinja2.ext' has no attribute 'autoescape', this is because autoescape has long been removed from the recent version of Jinga2 template to resolve this uninstall the currently installed version  and install the older version using this: pip install Jinja2==3.0.3, if your running on the sandbox i suppose you should be free from all the bugs i encourter if you are running locally then this and the previously mentioned solution ought to fix it, let's keep it up!
